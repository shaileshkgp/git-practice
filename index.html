      <p>
        Git is a free and open source distributed version control system
        designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with
        speed and efficiency.<br />
        Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast
        performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and
        ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging
        areas, and multiple workflows.
